// spacebar-related

In progress:

Completed:

* [CHANGED] all state changes to messages appear to happen immediately -- they are no longer dependent on getting a fast server response
* [CHANGED] single-selecting an unread message now immediately marks the message as read (selecting an unread message by extending an existing selection does not mark the message as read)
* [FIXED] if a read messages was marked as unread, selecting it would not re-mark it as read without reloading the app
* [NEW] OtherInbox now remembers your mailbox and message selections during usage
* [CHANGED] creating a new mailbox now happens in a new window, instead of replacing the current window

* [CHANGED] folder selection now occurs on mouseDown (previously was on mouseUp)
* [CHANGED] the folder list is no longer "focusable"; selecting a new folder will move focus to the mailbox list for that folder
* [CHANGED] dividers now have much larger targets for adjusting the splitter
